    The Worldwide Reference System 2 (WRS-2) is a global system used to catalog and organize satellite images,
    It divides the Earth's surface into a grid of path/row coordinates.

    Path: Refers to the satellite's orbit, with each path representing a specific line or track the satellite
    follows as it passes over the Earth.
    Row: Represents divisions along the satelliteâ€™s track (north to south), indicating different portions of the Earth's
    surface along that path.
